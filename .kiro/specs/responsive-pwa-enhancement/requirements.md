# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to transform the Purple Stock inventory management application into a fully responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides a native app-like experience across all devices. The current implementation has basic PWA functionality but lacks the responsive design patterns, touch interactions, and mobile-first optimizations needed for a seamless mobile experience. This enhancement will ensure users can effectively manage inventory on smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices with consistent, intuitive interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to adapt seamlessly to my device screen size and orientation, so that I can efficiently manage inventory on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app on a mobile device (320px-768px) THEN the sidebar SHALL collapse into a hamburger menu overlay
2. WHEN a user accesses the app on a tablet device (768px-1024px) THEN the sidebar SHALL be collapsible with touch-friendly controls
3. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly to the new orientation within 300ms
4. WHEN a user accesses the app on desktop (>1024px) THEN the sidebar SHALL remain expanded by default with hover interactions
5. WHEN content exceeds viewport height THEN scrolling SHALL be smooth and not interfere with fixed navigation elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want touch-optimized interactions throughout the app, so that I can easily navigate and perform actions with my fingers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps any interactive element THEN the touch target SHALL be at least 44px x 44px
2. WHEN a user performs touch gestures THEN the app SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
3. WHEN a user swipes on mobile THEN appropriate swipe actions SHALL be available for common tasks
4. WHEN a user long-presses on items THEN contextual actions SHALL be revealed
5. WHEN a user taps form inputs THEN the appropriate mobile keyboard SHALL appear with proper input types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker using a mobile device, I want optimized stock transaction flows, so that I can quickly process inventory changes while moving around the warehouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses stock transaction pages on mobile THEN forms SHALL be optimized for single-handed operation
2. WHEN a user scans barcodes THEN the camera interface SHALL be full-screen and touch-optimized
3. WHEN a user enters quantities THEN large, touch-friendly number inputs SHALL be provided
4. WHEN a user completes transactions THEN success feedback SHALL be prominent and clear
5. WHEN a user needs to switch between transaction types THEN navigation SHALL be accessible via bottom tab bar on mobile

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user installing the PWA, I want native app-like behaviors and appearance, so that the experience feels indistinguishable from a native mobile app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs the PWA THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
2. WHEN the PWA is launched THEN it SHALL display a custom splash screen with branding
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and app-like
4. WHEN the app loses network connectivity THEN it SHALL provide offline functionality for core features
5. WHEN the app regains connectivity THEN it SHALL sync pending changes automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with varying network conditions, I want the app to perform well on slow connections, so that I can continue working efficiently regardless of network quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the app on slow networks THEN critical content SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN images are loading THEN placeholder skeletons SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN appropriate retry mechanisms SHALL be provided
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN cached content SHALL be available for viewing
5. WHEN background sync is available THEN data changes SHALL be queued and synchronized when online

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user accessing the app in various lighting conditions, I want appropriate visual design and contrast, so that I can read and interact with content comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app THEN text SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio)
2. WHEN a user prefers dark mode THEN the app SHALL respect system dark mode preferences
3. WHEN a user is in bright sunlight THEN high contrast mode SHALL be available
4. WHEN interactive elements are focused THEN clear focus indicators SHALL be visible
5. WHEN content is loading THEN loading states SHALL be clearly indicated with appropriate animations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user managing inventory on mobile, I want efficient data entry and search capabilities, so that I can quickly find and update items without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for items THEN search results SHALL appear with minimal typing delay (<300ms)
2. WHEN a user enters data in forms THEN auto-complete and suggestions SHALL be provided where appropriate
3. WHEN a user makes input errors THEN validation feedback SHALL be immediate and helpful
4. WHEN a user needs to select from lists THEN mobile-optimized selection interfaces SHALL be provided
5. WHEN a user completes forms THEN data SHALL be saved automatically to prevent loss
