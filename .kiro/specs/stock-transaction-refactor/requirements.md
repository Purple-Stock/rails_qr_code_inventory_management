# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The stock transaction system currently has significant code duplication across four transaction types: stock in, stock out, adjust, and move. Each operation has nearly identical views (800+ lines each), JavaScript code, and controller methods with only minor variations in business logic, colors, and validation rules. This refactoring will consolidate the duplicated code into reusable components while maintaining all existing functionality and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate duplicated stock transaction code, so that the codebase is more maintainable and easier to extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the stock transaction views THEN all four transaction types (stock_in, stock_out, adjust, move) SHALL use shared components
2. WHEN examining the controller THEN duplicated methods SHALL be consolidated into reusable private methods
3. WHEN looking at JavaScript code THEN barcode scanning functionality SHALL be unified across all transaction types
4. WHEN checking the codebase THEN the total lines of code for stock transaction views SHALL be reduced by at least 60%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing stock transaction functionality to work exactly as before, so that the refactoring doesn't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing stock in operations THEN the functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN performing stock out operations THEN stock validation and quantity limits SHALL work as before
3. WHEN performing adjust operations THEN the adjustment calculations SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN performing move operations THEN the dual-location selection SHALL function as currently implemented
5. WHEN using barcode scanning THEN all scanning features SHALL work across all transaction types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to be easily extensible, so that adding new transaction types requires minimal code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new transaction type THEN it SHALL require only configuration changes and minimal new code
2. WHEN modifying transaction behavior THEN changes SHALL be made in centralized locations
3. WHEN updating the UI THEN changes SHALL automatically apply to all relevant transaction types
4. WHEN extending barcode functionality THEN the enhancement SHALL be available to all transaction types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clear separation of concerns in the refactored code, so that I can easily understand and modify specific aspects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code structure THEN business logic SHALL be separated from presentation logic
2. WHEN looking at view components THEN each component SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
3. WHEN reviewing JavaScript modules THEN functionality SHALL be organized into logical, reusable units
4. WHEN checking controller methods THEN each method SHALL follow the single responsibility principle

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the refactored code, so that I can confidently make future changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all existing functionality SHALL be covered by automated tests
2. WHEN testing shared components THEN each component SHALL have unit tests
3. WHEN testing controller refactoring THEN all transaction types SHALL have integration tests
4. WHEN checking test coverage THEN the refactored code SHALL maintain or improve current coverage levels
